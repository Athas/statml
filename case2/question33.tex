\section*{Question 3.3}
We have generated a matrix of $n$ dimensions times $m$ random Gauss samples.

For $1 \to n$ we calculate the average of the lenghts of the $m$ samples and the average of the $m^2$ distances between the $m$ samples.
These are then plotted as function of $n$:

We then plot the relation between the average length and the average distance:

From this graph we conclude that the relationship between length and distance
as a result of the dimensionally is a constant factor for every $n$.

This implies that the applicability of the k-NN method is not affected by the number of parameters.
