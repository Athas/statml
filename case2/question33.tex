\section*{Question 3.3}
\subsection*{requirements}
What do you observe? What happens for n  infty? What does this imply for nearest neighbor classification?
Deliverables: discussion of average length and distance of random vectors in high dimensional feature spaces

\subsection*{intention}
plot the two developments from 1 to 1000
plot the relation between the two 

describe how the constant ratio between the above shows that the applicability of k-NN is unaffected by the number of dimensions.

\subsubsection*{if there is more time, and T is happy}
ensure that the lazyness in generating the 1 to 1000 range of dimensions does
in fact, and not just intuitively, not affect the result.
