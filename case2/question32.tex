Applying the metric d to KnollC results in the exact same k-NN behavior as KnollA with the euclidean distance metric used in 3.1.

Given that KnollC is symmetrically equivalent to KnollC with the values on the x axis divided by 100 it is easy to see that multiplying vectors in KnollC with the matrix M makes them exactly equivalent to vectors at the same index in KnollA.

$\begin{pmatrix}
 100.000000 & 0.000000 \\
 0.000000 & 1.000000 \\
\end{pmatrix}
 \begin{pmatrix}
 0.003113  \\
 -1.045690
\end{pmatrix}
= \begin{pmatrix}
 0.311284  \\ 
-1.045690
\end{pmatrix}
