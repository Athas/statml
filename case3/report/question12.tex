\section*{Question 1.2}

The usefulness of the results in this section is in doubt, considering
the errors in our neural network implementation.

\subsection*{Question 1.2.1}

%\texttt{Deliverables:} 
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item \texttt{daniel: } plots of error trajectories and final solutions of neural networks with 2 and 20 neurons trained on the full dataset using $Rprop$ and steepest descent respectively
	
%	\item \texttt{daniel,med søtte fra troels} brief discussion of the plots 
%\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Question 1.2.1}
%\begin{itemize}
	
%	\item \texttt{daniel: } plots of error trajectories on $D_{train}$ and $D_{stop}$ and final solutions with and without early-stopping of neural networks with 2 and 20 neurons trained on the reduced data set using $Rprop$ and steepest descent
	
%	\item \texttt{daniel,med søtte fra troels} brief discussion of the plots
