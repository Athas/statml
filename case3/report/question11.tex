Derivation of $\sigma'(u)$ by straightforward symbolic
differentiation.

\begin{align*}
  \sigma'(u)=&\frac{d}{du}\sigma(u) & \text{Substituting def.} \\
  =&\frac{d}{du}\frac{u}{1+|u|} & \text{Substituting def.} \\
  =&\frac{u'(1+|u|)-|u|(1+|u|)'}{(1+|u|)^2} & \text{Quotient rule}\\
  =&\frac{(1+|u|)-|u|(0+1)}{(1+|u|)^2} & \text{Sum rule}\\
  =&\frac{1}{(1+|u|)^2} & \text{Adding terms}\\
\end{align*}
