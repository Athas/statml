\section*{Question 1.1}

%\texttt{Deliverables:}
%\begin{itemize}
	
%	\item \texttt{daniel: } source code of neural network with a single hidden layer including back-propagation to compute partial derivatives
	
%	\item \texttt{daniel: } verification of gradient computation using numerically estimated gradients;
%\end{itemize}

The source code for this assigment is in the file \texttt{11.R}.  The
neural network implementation supports arbitrary non-cyclic
connections between neurons by following the strategy of defining an
$M\times M$ matrix of weights as described in the lecture.  The matrix
is initialised by assigning it values uniformly distributed in the
interval $(-0.001, 0.001)$.

Derivation of $\sigma'(u)$ by straightforward symbolic
differentiation.

\begin{align*}
  \sigma'(u)=&\frac{d}{du}\sigma(u) & \text{Substituting def.} \\
  =&\frac{d}{du}\frac{u}{1+|u|} & \text{Substituting def.} \\
  =&\frac{u'(1+|u|)-|u|(1+|u|)'}{(1+|u|)^2} & \text{Quotient rule}\\
  =&\frac{(1+|u|)-|u|(0+1)}{(1+|u|)^2} & \text{Sum rule}\\
  =&\frac{1}{(1+|u|)^2} & \text{Adding terms}\\
\end{align*}

The table below was constructed with $\epsilon=0.0001$, $M=5, m=1,
d=1$ and data from the \texttt{sincTrain50.dt} set.  $\Phi$ was
randomly generated as mentioned above.

\begin{tabular}{c|c|r|r}
$i$ & $j$ & Analytical gradient & Numerical gradient \\\hline
\multirow{1}{*}{$2$} & $1$ & $0.004498441$ & $0$ \\\hline
\multirow{2}{*}{$3$} & $1$ & $-1.436347$ & $-0.009540368$ \\
& $2$ & $-1.040937^{-5}$ & $0$ \\\hline
\multirow{3}{*}{$4$} & $1$ & $-1.204136$ & $0$ \\
& $2$ & $1.054657^{-5}$ & $0$ \\
& $3$ & $0.001014082$ & $0$ \\\hline
\multirow{4}{*}{$5$} & $1$ & $13.23582$ & $13.23358$ \\
& $2$ & $0.002450268$ & $0.002443357$ \\
& $3$ & $-0.01310360$ & $-0.01303233$ \\
& $4$ & $-0.005316269$ & $0$ \\\hline
\end{tabular}

Clearly, the results are abberant for some connections, such as $1$ to
$4$ and $1$ to $3$, and not particularly accurate for the rest either.
We have been unable to locate the source of these deficiencies, but we
assume implementation error.
