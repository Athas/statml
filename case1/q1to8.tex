\section*{Question 1.1}

The following plot has been produced through straightforward use of
the \texttt{dnorm} function and plotting facilities in R.  A thousand
sample points have been used.  The code for this question is in the
file \texttt{question11.R}.

\section*{Question 1.2}

The matrix
\[
M=\left[\begin{matrix}
  x_{1,1}&\cdots&x_{1,m}\\\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\x_{n,1}&\cdots&x_{n,m} \end{matrix}\right]
\]
is \textit{positive definite} if for any nonzero real-entried vector
\[
V=\left[\begin{matrix} y_1 \\ \vdots \\ y_m \end{matrix}\right]
\]
we have
\[
V^TMV > 0.
\]

$M$ is \textit{symmetric} if $M^T=M$.

$M$ is \textit{square} if $m=n$.

An eigenvalue $\lambda$ is positive if $\lambda > 0$.

On a particular sampling the following sample covariance was observed
\[
\left[\begin{matrix}0.3085769&0.2101958\\0.2101958&0.2042408\end{matrix}\right]
\]
along with the sample mean
\[
\left[\begin{matrix}0.9855921\\0.9914642\end{matrix}\right]
\]

The Euclidian distance from the sample mean to the real mean is
\[
\sqrt{(0.9855921-1)^2+(0.9914642-1)^2}=0.01674
\]

This deviation could be due to the low number of samples.

As the bin width decreases, the random variation in the data results
in new local maximums that make the distribution appear more jagged
than it really is.

There is no best method to select bin widths, as the.  A common
method is Sturges' formula, where the $n$ data points are divided into
$\lceil\log_2n+1 \rceil$ bins.

\section*{Question 1.6}

The histogram is plotted with respect to density, rather than
frequency, so it can be easily compared to the density curve.  As can
be seen, the histogram with six bars fits the analytical curve well.

The marginal distribution has the following analytical expression.

\begin{align*}
  p(x_1) &= \mathcal{N}(x_1|\mu_1,\Sigma_{1,1}) & \text{By CB (2.98)}\\
  &=
  \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma_{1,1}^2)^{1/2}}\exp\left({-\frac{1}{2\sigma_{1,1}^2}(x_1-\mu_1)^2}\right)
  & \text{Substituting definition} \\
  &=
  \frac{1}{(2\pi\cdot 0.2^2)^{1/2}}\exp\left({-\frac{1}{2\cdot0.2^2}(x_1-1)^2}\right)
  & \text{Substituting $\sigma_{1,1}=0.2,\mu_1=1$}
\end{align*}

lines.
