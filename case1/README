The code is stored in the src/ subdirectory.

The R code is divided into three files:

  question11.R
  question131415.R
  question18.R

Each of them can be run directly (using the "source" command) and will
generate PDF plots in ../img relative to the working directory of the
R interpeter.  The "gplots" package is used to access the hist2d
function, and is thus necessary.  Note that question18.R takes rather
long to run, due to the need for repetitions.
